name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

# This workflow automatically builds and deploys the chess app to GitHub Pages
# whenever code is pushed to the main branch.
#
# Deployment Process:
# 1. Triggers on push to main branch
# 2. Sets up Node.js 20.x environment
# 3. Installs dependencies using npm ci (reproducible builds)
# 4. Runs lint and test checks (CI gate - deployment fails if these fail)
# 5. Builds the application using npm run build
# 6. Uploads the dist/ directory as a Pages artifact
# 7. Deploys to GitHub Pages
#
# Repository Settings Required:
# - GitHub Pages source must be set to "GitHub Actions" (not a branch)
# - The workflow requires pages: write and id-token: write permissions
#
# Deployment URL:
# - https://ysgrProgramming.github.io/chess-app/

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
