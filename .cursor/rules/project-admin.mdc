# Project Administration Rules

## 1. Branching Strategy
- **Main Branch:** `main` (Protected, Deployable)
  - No direct commits. All changes must come through Pull Requests.
  - Only humans (not AI) are allowed to press the "Merge" button.
- **Feature Branch:** `feature/issue-<number>-<short-description>`
  - Example: `feature/issue-42-user-login`
- **Fix Branch:** `fix/issue-<number>-<short-description>`

## 2. Conflict Resolution
- If a merge conflict occurs, the **Engineer** is responsible for resolving it.
- **Process:**
    1. Rebase `main` into the feature branch.
    2. Resolve conflicts manually.
    3. Run `make test` to ensure logic is still valid.
    4. Force push (if allowed on feature branch) or push to update PR.

## 3. Labels

- `task`: Normal implementation Issues created from requirements.
- `refactor`: Issues for architectural/technical debt cleanup.
- `in-progress`: Set by Engineer when starting work on an Issue.
- `ready-for-review`: (Optional) Set by Engineer when a PR is ready for Manager review.

## 4. Meta-Review Triggers
- The Manager performs meta-reviews and records findings as:
  - Comments on the relevant PR, and/or
  - New `refactor` Issues in GitHub.
The Manager must perform a meta-review when:
- A major milestone is reached (e.g., v0.1 release).
- 5+ PRs have been merged consecutively.
- A "Refactor" task is completed.

## 5. Roadmap Management
- `ROADMAP.md` must be the single source of truth for high-level progress.
- When an Issue is closed, the **Manager (or human owner)** updates the corresponding status in `ROADMAP.md` as part of meta-review or release planning.

## 6. Changing These Rules
- Changes to `.cursor/rules/project-admin.mdc` must go through:
  1. A dedicated Issue describing the proposed change.
  2. A Pull Request reviewed by the Manager.
