# Technical Stack & Security Rules

This file defines the strict security protocols (Universal) and the technology stack (Project-Specific).

## 1. Universal Security Protocols (Non-Negotiable)
These rules apply to **ALL** projects regardless of the language or framework.

### Credentials & Secrets
- `.env` and `.env.*` files are considered sensitive. Do NOT print, commit, or modify their contents via AI.
- **NEVER** commit API keys, tokens, passwords, or certificates to Git.
- **NEVER** hardcode secrets in the source code. Use environment variables.
- **NEVER** output secret values in logs, print statements, or PR descriptions.
- **Mocking:** External services requiring credentials must be mocked in tests.

### Experimental Code
- Any code that is "experimental", "temporary", or "proof of concept" must be placed in the `scratch/` directory.
- Files in `scratch/` are ignored by `.gitignore` and must **NOT** be included in Pull Requests.

---

## 2. Technology Stack (Dynamic)
*The Architect decides the conceptual stack in `REQUIREMENT.md`. The Manager then creates a "Project Setup" Issue, and the Engineer updates this file accordingly.*

### Core Stack
- **Language:** [PENDING: To be filled by Engineer]
- **Framework:** [PENDING: To be filled by Engineer]
- **Database:** [PENDING: To be filled by Engineer]

### Development Tools
- **Testing Framework:** [PENDING: To be filled by Engineer]
- **Linter/Formatter:** [PENDING: To be filled by Engineer]
- **Package Manager:** [PENDING: To be filled by Engineer]

---

## 3. Coding Standards (Dynamic)
*To be filled by the Engineer based on the chosen language's best practices.*

### Style Guide
- [PENDING: e.g., PEP8, Airbnb Style, Google Style]

### File Structure
- [PENDING: Brief description of the directory structure]

### Error Handling
- [PENDING: Project-specific error handling patterns]

## 4. Operational Rules for Modifying This File
- The **Universal Security Protocols** section is global and should only be changed in rare cases via a dedicated governance process (Issue + PR + human review).
- **Manager:** Do NOT edit this file directly. Create a `configuration` Issue instructing the Engineer to update the stack definitions.
- **Engineer:** Update the [PENDING] sections in this file as part of the "Project Setup" task or when a configuration change is requested via Issue.
